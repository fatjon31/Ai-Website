                    <h2>David (1501-1504)</h2>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>David is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created between 1501 and 1504,
                             by the Italian artist Michelangelo. It is a 5.17-metre (17.0 ft) marble statue 
                             of a standing male nude. The statue represents the Biblical hero David, 
                             a favoured subject in the art of Florence. It is possible that the David 
                             was conceived as a political statue before Michelangelo began to work on it. 
                             Certainly David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political figure in Florence, 
                             and images of the Biblical hero already carried political implications there.

                    <h2>Piet√† (1498-1499)</h2>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>The Piet√† (Italian: [mad…înna della pjeta]; "[Our Lady of] Pity"; 1498 1499) is a Carrara marble 
                            sculpture of Jesus and Mary at Mount Golgotha representing the "Sixth Sorrow" of the Virgin Mary 
                            by Michelangelo Buonarroti, in Saint Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, for which it was made.
                            It is a key work of Italian Renaissance sculpture and often taken as the start of the High Renaissance. 
                            The sculpture captures the moment when Jesus, taken down from the cross, is given to his mother 
                            Mary. Mary looks younger than Jesus; art historians believe Michelangelo was inspired by a passage 
                            in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: "O virgin mother, daughter of your Son  your merit so ennobled 
                            human nature that its divine Creator did not hesitate to become its creature"
                             (Paradiso, Canto XXXIII). 
                            Michelangelo's aesthetic interpretation of the Piet√† is unprecedented in Italian sculpture because 
                            it balances early forms of naturalism with the Renaissance ideals of classical beauty.</p>

                        <p>The Moses is a sculpture commissioned in 1505 by Pope Julius II...
                            Moses is an imposing figure‚Äîhe is nearly eight feet high sitting down! 
                            He has enormous muscular arms and an angry, intense look in his eyes. 
                            Under his arms he carries the tablets of the law‚Äîthe stones inscribed
                            with the Ten Commandments that he has just received from God on Mt. Sinai.
                            You might marvel at Moses horns. This comes from a mistranslation of a
                            Hebrew word that described Moses as having rays of light coming from his head.
